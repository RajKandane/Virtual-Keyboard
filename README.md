# HUMAN-COMPUTER INTERACTION USING ON-AIR VIRTUAL KEYBOARD
Aug 2022 - Present


[Objective:]

--Develop a user friendly interface through adaptation of key size and centroid distance between keys.

--Develop a finger action detection system was proposed to realise in air typing interface.


[Introduction:]

--Artificial Intelligence is the ability of computers to analyze the data, find patterns and correlation to predict future work.

--Virtual keyboard uses Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence to let uses work on any surface as if it were a keyboard.

--With a touchless virtual keyboard, there is no cleaning required, and they have no wires, buttons, or switches to maintain.

--Built â€“in convolutional layer in Convolutional Neural Network reduces the high dimensionality of images without losing its information

--CNN is highly used for images classification, gesture recognition and object detection because of that not only solve the several issues but also provide feasible use
virtual keyboard application.

--OpenCV has a bunch of pre-trained classifiers that can be used to identify finger and gesture.

--With the help of OpenCV, we can build an enormous number of applications that work better in real time.
