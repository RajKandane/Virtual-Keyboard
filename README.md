Finger Motion Estimation with Virtual Key:
- This component is responsible for estimating the motion of the user's fingers based on the input from the camera.
- It utilizes computer vision algorithms to track the movement of fingers in real-time.

Finger Touch Classification Model:
- The finger touch classification model analysis the motion estimation data to classify whether a finger is touching or not touching a virtual key.
- It uses Hand Tracking Module that can distinguish between touch and non-touch gestures.

Touch and Non-touch:
- Based on the classification results from the finger touch classification model, the system determines whether a finger is touching a virtual key or not.
- If a touch is detected, the system proceeds to the typing phase.

Typing:
- In the typing phase, the system identifies the specific virtual key that is being touched by the user's finger.
- It maps the touch location to the corresponding key on the virtual keyboard.
